# Alfresco Custom Record Type
Suppose you have a DoD 5015 record management site in Share. There is an action "Add Record Metadata" for a document that has been filed as record. The list of record types consists of "PRD Record", "Web Record" etc. which are implemented in DoD 5015 RM module. This is an example to show how to extend DoD 5015 module to add a custom "ACME Record" type.
