# Alfresco Custom Record Type
Suppose you have a DoD 5015 record management site in Share. After a document is declared as record, you can use the action "Add Record Metadata". Share prompts a list of record types such as "PDF Record", "Web Record" etc. which are implemented in DoD 5015 RM module. This example shows how to extend DoD 5015 module to add a custom "ACME Record" type.
